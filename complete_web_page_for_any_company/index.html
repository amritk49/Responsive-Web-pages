                    It seems as if Lionel Messi breaks a goalscoring record every other week, 
                    such is his mindblowing knack for finding the back of the net. He became 
                    Barcelona's all time leading scorer at the age of 24, broke Gerd Muller's 
                    39 year old record for the most goals scored in a single season (73), and 
                    is the all time leading scorer in La Liga.He also broke Gerd Muller's 40 
                    year old record for most goals in a calendar year, scoring a staggering 91 
                    goals in 69 games for club and country in 2012.He is simply one of the 
                    greatest goalscorers of all time and will no doubt set even more practically 
                    unbreakable records throughout his career.
                    <br> <br> 
                    Remarkably, Ronaldo matches Messi's ability to find the back of the net and 
                    can also be considered as one of the greatest goalscorers of all time.In fact,
                    better goalscoring ratio than Messi since arriving at Real Madrid in 2009, 
                    with an astonishing 406 goals in just 394 appearances in all competitions
                    for Real Madrid as of the end of the 2016/17 season (a ratio of 1.03 goals
                    per game compared to Messi's 1.01 over the same period).Since adapting
                    his game to a more focused centre-forward role, Ronaldo has also raced
                    ahead of his rival in the all time European Cup scoring charts too, despite 
                    Messi being the first to break Raul's previous Champions League goals record.
